AJO CLASS/FUNCTIONS

The basic unit of Ziwen's functions is not an individual Reddit post on r/translator per se, but rather, an Ajo.
An Ajo class (from Esperanto aÄµo, meaning 'thing') is constructed from a Reddit post but is saved locally and contains 
additional information that cannot be stored on Reddit's system. 
In Ziwen, changes to a post's language, state, etc. are made first to the Ajo. Then a function within the class can
determine its flair, flair text, and template. 

Note: Wenyuan (as of version 3.0) also uses Ajos for its statistics-keeping.

External Ajo-specific/related functions are all prefixed with `ajo` in their name. The Ajo class itself contains several
class functions.

class Ajo:
    """
    A equivalent of a post on r/translator. Used as an object for Ziwen and Wenyuan to work with for
    consistency with languages and to store extra data.

    The process is: Submission > Ajo (changes made to it) > Ajo.update().
    After a submission has been turned into an Ajo, Ziwen will only work with the Ajo unless it has to update Reddit's
    flair.

    Attributes:

        id: A Reddit submission that forms the base of this class.
        created_utc: The Unix time that the item was created.
        author: The Reddit username of the creator. [deleted] if not found.
        author_messaged: A boolean that marks whether or not the creator has been messaged that their post has been
                         translated.

        type: single, multiple

        country_code: The ISO 3166-2 code of a country associated with the language. None by default.
        language_name: The English name of the post's language, rendered as a string
                       (Note: Unknown, Nonlanguage, and Conlang posts, etc. count as a language_name)
        language_code_1: The ISO 639-1 code of a post's language, rendered as a string. None if non-existent.
        language_code_3: The ISO 639-3 code of a post's language, rendered as a string.
        language_history: The different names the post has been classified as, stored as a list (in sequence)

        status: The current situation of the post. untranslated, translated, needs review, in progress, or missing.
        title: The title of the post, minus the language tag part. Defaults to the reg. title if it's not determinable.
        title_original: The exact Reddit title of the post.
        script_name: The type of script it's classified as (None normally)
        script_code: Corresponding code

        is_supported: Boolean of whether this is a supported CSS class or not.
        is_bot_crosspost: Is it a crosspost from u/translator-BOT?

        is_identified: Is it a changed class?
        is_long: Is it a long post?
        is_script: Is it an Unknown post whose script has been identified?

        original_source_language_name: The ORIGINAL source language(s) it was classified as.
        original_target_language_name: The ORIGINAL target language(s) it was classified as.
        direction: Is the submission to/from English, both/neither.

        output_oflair_css: The CSS class that it should be flaired as.
        output_oflair_text: The text that accompanies it.

        parent_crosspost: If it's a crosspost, what's the original one.

        time_delta:  The time between the initial submission time and it being marked. This is a dictionary.

        Example of an output for flair is German (Identified/Script) (Long)
